#x+y
#x-y
#x*y
#x/y

# 2 ways to compute the result
# depends on what you are going to do with the result


#1
# to use the result later in the program or  
print("---------------    1     ----------------")

print(z)
z = x-y
print(z)
z = x*y
print(z)

#2
# to use the result calculated once or printing 
#NOTE:- both the answers are correct , its just about what to you want to do with the result.
